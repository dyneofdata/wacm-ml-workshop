# WACM Machine Learning Workshop

Walking through basic machine learning concepts and algorithms with Python

### Dependencies

1. [Anaconda for Python 3](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) comes with Jupyter notebook and needed libraries, e.g., numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn.
2. Graphviz is needed to visualize learned decision tree. To install, run in command line:
  ```
  pip install graphviz
  conda install graphviz
  ```
  
### Companion slides

Coming soon! The codes in the Jupyter Notebook will be stepped through for the corresponding topic in the slidedeck.
